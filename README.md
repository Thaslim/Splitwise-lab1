# Splitwise-lab1
React application with Express server and Mysql database - Splitwise Simulation
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 
Then an Express server was added in the backend directory. The server is proxied via the proxy key in package.json.

Using this project
Clone the project, cd into the directory and install the dependencies
import .sql file into mysql server

```
git clone https://github.com/Thaslim/Splitwise-lab1.git
cd frontend
npm install
cd backend
npm install
```

## Setup .env file
Create a .env file in your backend config folder which will hold database config and passwords 
You can start the client and server on its own with the command:
```npm start```
The application runs on ```http://localhost:3000/```
